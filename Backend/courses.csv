COMPSCI 696QA,Computer Science,COMPSCI,696QA,Independent Study- Multilingual Reprepresentations for Cross-lingual NLP,"Oracle is an multinational corporation that develops products and builds tools in many different languages. An important practical problem is to make natural language processing (NLP) tools (document classification, named entity recognition, etc.) available in every such language. Traditionally, an NLP practitioner would collect training data in every language for every task for every domain, but such data collection is expensive and time-consuming. Further, many resources available in a language such as English are not available in languages with fewer speakers. In this project, we want to explore a solution to multilingual NLP that does not exclusively require labeling so much data. In particular, we would like to harness unlabeled multilingual data to learn a common representation under which structure is shared across different languages. For example, in such a space, the vector for the English word ""good"" is close to the vector for the French word ""bon."" Then, by employing the multilingual representation as features, we can train a classifier in one language and have it generalize to other languages, without much additional labeled data.  In this project we will (1) explore how to learn a good multilingual representation (2) study how the number and class of languages affect the quality of the multilingual embedding space, and (3) study how well the multilingual representations allow us to transfer NLP models across different languages.",3,Graduate,,,[List]

COMPSCI 791DM,Computer Science,COMPSCI,791DM,Seminar - Building a Deep Mind in the 21st Century,"Many cognitive abilities once solely the province of biological systems are now routinely achievable with machines. Once no more than a dream, abilities such as complex 3D perception, natural language, machine translation, speech recognition, learning, and reasoning are now routinely achievable even on low cost hardware, such as cellphones, tablets, or similar devices, which can access larger scale servers for offline computation. This seminar explores the next frontiers for AI, presuming that many human cognitive abilities will be largely achieved in the next decade (vision, language, learning, reasoning, speech recognition), with the massive computing and data resources likely to be available to individuals and to corporations like Google, Baidu, Facebook, and IBM. To put it another way, core cognitive abilities are no longer ""mysteries."" but matters of mundane albeit challenging engineering.  What's left for AI? Will ""artificial intelligence"" be achieved when machines achieve human level performance in these core cognitive abilities, or, as one philosopher put it in the early heady days of AI, have we merely climbed a tall tree on the way to getting to the moon? Our thesis is that the really interesting aspects of AI are only now beginning to be possible, given that the ""operating system"" level functionalities listed above are achievable. This seminar will discuss how AI research in the next decade or two can begin to tackle each of these problems.  1. Emotion: current AI systems can learn effectively from reinforcement, but feel no emotion. Is emotion necessary to build truly intelligent cyborgs? We explore the current theories of emotion, and its connections to rational decision making.  2. Consciousness: AI systems can carry out inference and reason about choices, but are not conscious of their own self, in the sense that most mammals are. What's missing? We review the current theories of consciousness.  3. Curiosity: AI systems can be programmed to carry out tasks using high level rewards and goals, but seem incapable of setting themselves their own tasks and goals. How can we build AI systems that are curious in the sense that children are. What are the essential elements of curiosity?  4. Mortality: AI systems have no fear of ?death? and do not concern themselves with their ""mortality,"" in the sense that humans (and presumably other mammals) do. However, as AI systems learn from experience and compile massive knowledge bases, they may face similar challenges in being ""unplugged,"" faced with the loss of everything they know and have learned. (HAL in 2001: A Space Odyssey certainly feared its own death). Why is mortality important to incorporate in future AI systems?",3,Graduate,,,[List]
