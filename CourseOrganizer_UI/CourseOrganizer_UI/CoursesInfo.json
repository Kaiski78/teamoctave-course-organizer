We will explore the steps in the acquisition, preservation, analysis, and courtroom presentation of digital evidence. We'll see how this information can be recovered from many sources, including file systems, operating systems, networks, database systems, applications, media files, and embedded systems. This survey of practical techniques will be complemented with a study of the theoretical underpinnings that support them: information theory; bit, byte, and character encoding algorithms; string matching algorithms; data structures commonly used in file and network systems; etc. We'll learn about existing tools for digital forensics, such as The Sleuth Kit and Wireshark, and we'll learn to write our own. We will also touch upon more advanced topics, such as stenography, anti-forensics, cryptography, timeline generation, and authorship attribution.  Prerequisites: AP Computer Science or general competency in a high-level programming language such as Python, Java, or C++.",

These are systems success stories - they are reliable, available (\"up\" nearly all the time), handle an unbelievable amount of load from users around the world, yet provide virtually instantaneous results. On the other hand, many computer systems don't perform nearly as well as Google - hence the now-cliche \"the system is down.\" In this class, we study the scientific principles behind the construction of high-performance, scalable systems. The course begins with a discussion of data representation, and moves up the stack from there to the features of modern architectures, assembly languages, and operating system services such as I/O, process, and synchronization.",

This emerging paradigm, namely the Internet of Things (IoT), has great potential to impact how individuals live and work by providing a source of innovative decision making.  The design of the IoT, which is defined as \"a internetwork of physical items -- each embedded with sensors -- that are connected to the Internet\", requires the understanding of embedded electronics, software, sensors, network, and data analytics.  To prepare our students as forerunners of this future, this course will introduce a wide range of topics in the broad areas of IoT, and provide hands-on experiences via a series of exciting projects.  This course counts as a CS Elective for the CS Major (BA or BS).",

Specific topics include linear and non-linear regression, (stochastic) gradient descent, neural networks, backpropagation, classification, Markov decision processes, state-value and action-value functions, temporal difference learning, actor-critic algorithms, the reward prediction error hypothesis for dopamine, connectionism for philosophy of mind, and ethics, safety, and fairness considerations when applying machine learning to real-world problems.

This course covers practical skills in reverse engineering and binary exploitation, and examines the techniques used by hackers in recent major security incidents. The course objective is to provide students with a strong understanding of attack patterns, and to ensure students implement more secure coding practices in their own code.  This course begins with an introduction to Intel-based assembly, reverse engineering, vulnerability analysis, and various forms of Linux-focused binary exploitation. The course then covers stack, heap and Linux kernel-based exploitation, and dive into common defensive mitigations such as ASLR, NX and Stack Cookies alongside techniques to bypass each of them. This course counts as a CS Elective for the CS Major (BA or BS).",

We'll also look at the efficiency of the network architectures for peer-to-peer/distributed system communication and attacks on their security, such as denial of service attacks. And we'll review relevant applied cryptography such as elliptic curves. We'll discuss in detail the mechanisms of Bitcoin and Ethereum and we'll program distributed applications for Ethereum. Other topics include economics and finance. The course is based on a flipped classroom. This course counts as a CS Elective toward the CS major (BA or BS), as well an any 2 menu choice for the former Security & Privacy track.",

    "description": "Managing agile development of complex web systems is a difficult task. These applications require a broad range of conceptual understanding ranging from user interface design and client/server-side concepts and programming to caching, monitoring, scalability, and performance issues. These techniques need to work collectively to bring the end user a single working system. Unlike traditional waterfall methods of software development that demand a focus on design before development, agile development emphasizes techniques that require an iterative design, development, and deploy process. Test driven development is the focus and a working system is always available for review. This 1 credit course will require students to be managers that lead a software development team (students enrolled in 497S) to the successful completion and deployment of a real web application. Students enrolled in this course will be required to hold team meetings, manage work and design, and evaluate the individual work and contributions of students taking 497S and meet with the instructor to read and discuss agile software development and techniques from the literature. Prerequisites: CMPSCI 230 or 220 and 326. Co-requisites: 497S.",

Access to an abundance of open source languages, libraries, and frameworks has led to the quick and easy construction of a variety of applications with several moving parts working in coordination to present to the user the illusion of a single program. In reality, web applications are extremely difficult to get right. They involve a large collection of coordinated services, multiple databases, complicated user interfaces, security and performance issues, and ever changing 3rd party services, spread across physical and virtual machines. These complications are further stressed by the large number of concurrent users that access these applications every second. This course will investigate several well known web-based applications and the technology and software architecture used to scale these applications. We will also study a specific topic related to scalability in software design in the context of web application architecture.

    "description": "The primary goal of this course is for students to be comfortable with exploring educational datasets and analyzing them, finding patterns in educational data, creating models that summarize and describe data, and creating predictive models, using a variety of techniques that span machine learning, data mining, and statistics. We will work with datasets that come from educational learning technologies, tutoring and assessment software, as well as other datasets that students might be interested in (e.g. datasets from students grades classes, many of which are publicly available through national sources). Students are encouraged to bring their own datasets of interest, if they have them or want to. Another goal is to understand how current researchers in the field of educational data mining, AI in Education, and educational technology are using a variety of techniques to understand and model their data. We will cover many different methods, from machine learning methods applied to educational data and classic models inspired by cognitive theory. We will also cover various applications including computerized adaptive testing, affect detection, reading and writing analysis, activity log analysis, and instructional policy design.  This course counts as a CS Elective for the BS or BA.",

    "description": "Recent years have seen a dramatic rise in the use of algorithms for solving problems involving strategic decision makers. Deployed algorithms now assist in a variety of economic interactions: assigning medical residents to schools, allocating students to courses, allocating security resources in airports, allocating computational resources and dividing rent. We will explore foundational topics at the intersection of economics and computation, starting with the foundations of game theory: Nash equilibria, the theory of cooperative games, before proceeding to covering more advanced topics: matching algorithms, allocation of indivisible goods, and mechanism design. This course counts as a CS Elective for the BA or BS.",

The course will begin with a description of simple classifiers such as perceptrons and logistic regression classifiers, and move on to standard neural networks, convolutional neural networks, some elements of recurrent neural networks, and transformers. The emphasis will be on understanding the basics and on practical application more than on theory. Many applications will be in computer vision, but we will make an effort to cover some natural language processing (NLP) applications as well. The current plan is to use Python and associated packages such as Numpy and TensorFlow. Required background includes Linear Algebra, Probability and Statistics, and Multivariate Calculus. All assignments will be in the Python programming language.",

    "description": "Many important problems that arise in practical applications of discrete optimization are NP-hard. This implies no polynomial time algorithms exist for these problems unless P==NP. The field of approximation algorithms has developed to tackle this difficulty by designing polynomial time algorithms to solve otherwise intractable problems near-optimally. Approximation algorithms provide rigorous guarantees on approximation factors indicating how far the solution can be in the worst case. This paradigm has become a cornerstone in algorithm design, and this course aims to cover a comprehensive list of topics in this area at the graduate level. Towards the end of the course, we will also explore 'hardness of approximation': study of the best approximation factor possible in polynomial time. A tentative list of topics include:  Techniques - Greedy algorithms, local search, dynamic programming, randomized methods, LP techniques, primal-dual method, lagrangian methods, semi-definite programming, metric method, hardness of approximation. Problems - Set cover, Vertex cover, TSP and other planning problems, Scheduling and Generalized assignment problems, Facility Location, Steiner tree and other network design problems, Sparsest cut, multicut and other graph partitioning problems, MaxSat, Graph coloring, Approximate counting, Algorithms on sequences etc.",

Many computer, engineering, and information scientists strive to develop innovative technologies to monitor patients' health conditions and provide interventions to make meaningful changes in health-related outcomes. This course introduces the fundamental disciplines of quantitative and qualitative health informatics to help students push their innovative technologies outside the laboratory and prepare them as forerunners of the future of digital health care systems. Quantitatively, the course will cover the fundamentals of clinical studies focusing on how to demonstrate the clinical/health effectiveness and validity of new personalized health technologies (e.g., sensors, systems, analytic methods). We will cover topics like human subject study design (e.g., randomized controlled trials) and hypothesis testing (e.g., t-test, ANOVA, correlation test, etc.). Qualitatively, this course will cover human-centered design approaches focusing on how mobile systems and health data could interact with important stakeholders (e.g., patients, clinicians, and caregivers) and translate into practice. We will cover methods to obtain qualitative data (e.g., interviews and observations) and analyze the obtained data (e.g., thematic analysis).",

These challenges become increasingly important in techno-social systems affecting human high-stake decision making, which is often regulated by law. In this course, students will learn techniques for robust model evaluation, model selection, causal discovery, explainable and fair artificial intelligence, and interpretable models. In addition, students will reason about representativeness, transparency, and legal aspects of techno-social systems. The course will review both cutting-edge research and relevant portions of recent open-access textbooks. Coursework includes reading recent research papers, programming assignments, and a final group project. After completing the course, students should be able to develop, investigate, evaluate, and deploy artificial intelligence systems more responsibly.",

    "description": "Artificial Intelligence will radically change education. Through machine learning, data mining, analytics, robotics, and user models, AI will replace false learning boundaries (e.g., learning places, time, level of study); personalize learning; make learning instantly available to everyone; connect learners with partners; provide multi-media; and augment human learning ability. This seminar examines recent work in explanatory and tutoring systems, presents theories about digital teaching and learning, and describes how to deliver personalized teaching in online systems. Such software supports people working alone or in collaborative inquiry to rapidly access and integrate global information. This course describes how to build tutors, stimulates awareness of research issues, and promotes sound analytic and design skills. Specific topics include systems that support collaboration, inquiry, natural language dialogue, authoring tools and user models. The course is appropriate for students from many disciplines (e.g., computer science, linguistics, education, and psychology), researchers, and practitioners from academia, industry, and government. No programming is required. Students will read and critique papers about AI tools (e.g., vision, natural language), methods, and will study the complexity of human learning through advances in cognitive science. Weekly assignments invite students to critique the literature and a final project requires a detailed specification (not a program) for a tutor on your chosen topic. Students present readings from the research literature and several working systems will be available for hands-on or virtual critique.",

From a simulation point of view, causal models could provide methods for enabling new kinds of tractable probabilistic reasoning about models, for learning models directly from data, and for learning high-level abstractions of a detailed mechanistic model. From a causal-modeling viewpoint, simulation modeling could provide a means to enhance the expressiveness of languages for high-level statistical models with finer-grained mechanistic and generative semantics.  Topics will include simulation, causal learning and reasoning, model-based RL, simulation metamodeling, probabilistic programming, process mining, and discovery of causal mechanisms.",

This is an emerging topic at the intersection of theoretical computer science and machine learning. Generally speaking, a result in this area takes a problem with strong information-theoretic lower bounds (for instance on the competitive ratio), identifies a compact prediction that can be learned from real data, and gives a proof tying the performance of the algorithm to the quality of the underlying prediction. The field has blossomed with applications to a broad range of classic domains in theoretical computer science such as classical streaming algorithms, online scheduling, clustering, filtering data structures, and many others. The focus of this seminar, however, will be on online algorithms with predictions.",

    "description": "Over the last few years, a wave of excitement about machine learning (ML) and deep learning has proliferated from academia to industry, transforming prototypes in research labs to valid solutions to real-world problems. Using ML entails developing end-to-end pipelines to collect data, clean it, and run learning and inference algorithms in a scalable manner. This results in computationally intense workloads and complex software pipelines. Systems for ML help users organize their data and scale these computationally intense problems to larger and larger datasets.  At the same time, ML is having an increasing impact on systems design. Fine-tuned analytical heuristics and cost models are being replaced by learned models, following trends observed in other fields.  This seminar will review cutting-edge research on these topics and allow students to work on a hands-on project. It will focus on reading, presenting, and discussing recent papers in the domains of ML for systems and systems for ML (1 credit) and a final project focusing on a specific ML system topic (3 credits).",

    "description": "Previous efforts (Mimno and McCallum, 2008) have demonstrated the usefulness of topic models for understanding the dynamics of the job market. Using a corpus of resumes as training data, we can build a topic model that summarizes the structure of the job market as a whole, where the \"topics\" are sets of skills required for different positions. In addition, by capturing the sequential aspect of the resume data, we can construct a sequence model to more accurately predict state (role) transitions for individuals over time. The goal of this project is to build on this work and expand its scope to better understand workforce characteristics at a macro level. Example questions examined might include: Which roles are currently underserved by the talent pipeline? Are there differing risk/reward scenarios associated with different career paths that can be mitigated through strategy? What types of roles have the most variability in terms of career path? Students will be responsible for creating a set of analysis tools that interface with a data set consisting of parsed resumes, along with any outside data sources that are useful.",

Beyond-classroom educational opportunities are an excellent way to gain practical experience on a substantial project, to learn advanced skills, to collaborate with a professional PhD researcher, to form a connection to a data science company, and to work in a team with other graduate students.  Industry partners propose semester-long data science projects.  Students form three-to-five-person teams, each of which work on one project throughout the semester, under the guidance of their industry mentor, additional PhD student mentors, and the course faculty instructor.  Furthermore, in weekly class meetings all students receive professional development education, data science hardware and software infrastructure training, data science research presentations, and career advice.  Student teams gain valuable oral presentation experience and feedback by regularly presenting their work-in-progress, as well as a final public presentation of their project at the end of the semester.  Advantages of these industry relationships often include access to rich industry-scale data, learning about real-world problems, and making industry connections useful for the future.",

    "description": "Meta is an AI company specializing in big data analysis of scientific and technical literature. We use world-leading machine learning to help academics, commercial enterprises and government organizations solve their science and IP challenges. Meta's Bibliometrics Intelligence ( http://meta.com/publishing ) creates automated and in-depth manuscript profiles to provide authors, editors, and publishers with valuable data to ensure that publishable manuscripts find the right home within a publisher's portfolio. In this project, we will examine the use of advanced techniques to automate and improve the very first step of the manuscript processing pipeline. The task involves identifying and extracting elements from the PDF file including title, abstract, authors, affiliations, and references. Unlike published articles, PDF manuscripts are provided with no consistent formatting, added headers for editors and reviewers, line numbers, and other noisy elements. Cleanly labelling the metadata is crucial for proper downstream processing.We will leverage existing PDF parsing technology that provides detailed information about the text and formatting of the manuscript. While some data is available to bootstrap training, it is likely that additional data will have to be annotated as part of the project. We will explore the use of conditional random field and advanced deep learning techniques to accurately label and extract the metadata to allow further downstream processing.",

    "title": "Independent Study- Multilingual Reprepresentations for Cross-lingual NLP",
    "description": "Oracle is an multinational corporation that develops products and builds tools in many different languages. An important practical problem is to make natural language processing (NLP) tools (document classification, named entity recognition, etc.) available in every such language. Traditionally, an NLP practitioner would collect training data in every language for every task for every domain, but such data collection is expensive and time-consuming. Further, many resources available in a language such as English are not available in languages with fewer speakers. In this project, we want to explore a solution to multilingual NLP that does not exclusively require labeling so much data. In particular, we would like to harness unlabeled multilingual data to learn a common representation under which structure is shared across different languages. For example, in such a space, the vector for the English word \"good\" is close to the vector for the French word \"bon.\" Then, by employing the multilingual representation as features, we can train a classifier in one language and have it generalize to other languages, without much additional labeled data.  In this project we will (1) explore how to learn a good multilingual representation (2) study how the number and class of languages affect the quality of the multilingual embedding space, and (3) study how well the multilingual representations allow us to transfer NLP models across different languages.",

    "title": "Seminar - Building a Deep Mind in the 21st Century",
    "description": "Many cognitive abilities once solely the province of biological systems are now routinely achievable with machines. Once no more than a dream, abilities such as complex 3D perception, natural language, machine translation, speech recognition, learning, and reasoning are now routinely achievable even on low cost hardware, such as cellphones, tablets, or similar devices, which can access larger scale servers for offline computation. This seminar explores the next frontiers for AI, presuming that many human cognitive abilities will be largely achieved in the next decade (vision, language, learning, reasoning, speech recognition), with the massive computing and data resources likely to be available to individuals and to corporations like Google, Baidu, Facebook, and IBM. To put it another way, core cognitive abilities are no longer \"mysteries.\" but matters of mundane albeit challenging engineering.  What's left for AI? Will \"artificial intelligence\" be achieved when machines achieve human level performance in these core cognitive abilities, or, as one philosopher put it in the early heady days of AI, have we merely climbed a tall tree on the way to getting to the moon? Our thesis is that the really interesting aspects of AI are only now beginning to be possible, given that the \"operating system\" level functionalities listed above are achievable. This seminar will discuss how AI research in the next decade or two can begin to tackle each of these problems.  1. Emotion: current AI systems can learn effectively from reinforcement, but feel no emotion. Is emotion necessary to build truly intelligent cyborgs? We explore the current theories of emotion, and its connections to rational decision making.  2. Consciousness: AI systems can carry out inference and reason about choices, but are not conscious of their own self, in the sense that most mammals are. What's missing? We review the current theories of consciousness.  3. Curiosity: AI systems can be programmed to carry out tasks using high level rewards and goals, but seem incapable of setting themselves their own tasks and goals. How can we build AI systems that are curious in the sense that children are. What are the essential elements of curiosity?  4. Mortality: AI systems have no fear of ?death? and do not concern themselves with their \"mortality,\" in the sense that humans (and presumably other mammals) do. However, as AI systems learn from experience and compile massive knowledge bases, they may face similar challenges in being \"unplugged,\" faced with the loss of everything they know and have learned. (HAL in 2001: A Space Odyssey certainly feared its own death). Why is mortality important to incorporate in future AI systems?",
